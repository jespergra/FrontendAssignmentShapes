                You can click somewhere on the screen to place a red pointer, when you have placed 3 points the fourth one will appear in the color green.
                The paralellogram and the circle with same area are also drawn at this moment.
                Up in the left corner can you see information like coordinates and the area of the shapes. 
                Click and hold optional red point to move the point. 
                The program will automatically place the fourth and green point and then redraw the circle and the paralellogram, also the new area and coordinates will be updated accordingly.
